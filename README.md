# Defi AI 2022

This package provides a Python interface to scrape, save and load data from a Google Cloud SQL server.

In addition, we have `train.py` for training a model based on the data we collected and `app.py` for a Gradio demo.

Unfortunately, some networks refuse to connect to a Google Cloud SQL Endpoint so if you are having a problem with connection timeout, please use a VPN or a different network.

## How to use

This app aims to give user a close experience to a normal "searching hotel price" experience.

- Enter an username in `Signup username` or leave it as a random string and press `Signup`.
- New user will automatically appear in `Login username`. Choose one username and press `Login`.
- The `Current user` shows which user is currently logged in.
- Choose `Languages`, `Is mobile`, `Date before` and `City`.
- Press `Get price`, the price will be shown in `Price`.
- `Past requests` show the previous requests made by the current user and will automatically reload if:
  - The current user makes a new price request (press the `Get Price` button).
  - A new user logged in.
- Choose one of `Past requests` and press `Get past request` to view the response corresponding to that request.
